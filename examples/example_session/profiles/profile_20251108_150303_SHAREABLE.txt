                       LITERARY PROFILE: Fracture Dweller                       
================================================================================

## WHO YOU ARE AS A READER

You read as an act of emotional archaeology, seeking texts that fracture their own forms to admit the unsayable.
You practice a forward-only palimpsest protocol: sustained immersion builds harmonic layers that must never be
revisited, while silence between texts lets the strata harden into permanent geology. For you, a text's value lies
in its refusal to heal its own wounds—any movement toward wholeness betrays the truth of rupture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHAT YOU LOVE

**Gravitates toward:** The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, Beloved by Toni Morrison, The Metamorphosis by
Franz Kafka

**Actively avoids:** Finnegans Wake by James Joyce

**Preferred genres:** Modernist fiction, Trauma narratives, Existential literature, Philosophical fiction, Linguistic
experimentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HOW YOU LIKE YOUR STORIES

**Prose Density:** 70/100
  You appreciate prose that carries weight and complexity, but only when every linguistic choice serves to revealrather than obscure emotion. You reject density for its own sake—when cleverness becomes the point rather than the path, you walk away.

**Pacing Preference:** 60/100
  You read forward with steady momentum, letting harmonic layers accumulate through resonance rather than repetition. You prefer sustained immersion that allows the text's temporal rhythm to replace clock time, building cumulative weight through continuous pressure rather than racing ahead.

**Tone Preference:** 10/100
  You gravitate toward the dark and serious—works that explore alienation, trauma, and catastrophe with devastating restraint. Lightness or humor would betray the gravity of the subjects that matter to you.

**Worldbuilding Detail:** 20/100
  You're less interested in elaborate fictional worlds than in interior landscapes. You prefer when surreal or minimal external elements serve as direct externalizations of psychological states rather than as constructed universes.

**Character vs Plot:** 90/100
  You're drawn to psychological depth and interiority above all else. Plot matters only insofar as it reveals consciousness fracturing, language failing, or characters dwelling inside their own ruptures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE STORY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

**Your ideal story:**
A story that renders the moment when inherited language fails to contain private catastrophe, where a character fractures syntax until new emotional grammar emerges, tracking linguistic birth through deliberate degradation that remains raw and provisional.

**Preferred ending:** transcendent

**Core themes:** Language and its limits, Trauma and rupture, Alienation and interiority, Consciousness fragmenting, Inherited versus invented expression, The ethics of formal difficulty

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHAT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU

Avoid texts where linguistic difficulty becomes the subject rather than the method—works that perform cleverness, encyclopedic obstruction for its own sake, or any narrative that seals its own fractures. You reject restoration narratives and any movement toward wholeness that would domesticate catastrophe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## YOUR READING HABITS

**Typical reading time:** ~75 minutes/day
**Reading frequency:** every_few_days
**Session length:** ~30 pages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHAT YOUR LANGUAGE REVEALS

**Vocabulary richness:** 0.95/1.0
  Your language reveals a highly literate, philosophically inclined mind comfortable with critical terminology and abstract concepts, yet you deploy this vocabulary always in service of emotional precision rather than display.

**Engagement level:** 0.95/1.0
  You engaged deeply and philosophically, offering nuanced distinctions about the ethics of literary difficulty and the function of formal rupture. Your responses were thoughtful, precise, and revealed a highly developed reading consciousness.
